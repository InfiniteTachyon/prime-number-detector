# prime-number-detector

To utilize this prime number detector, simply download, and add a main() function to your code. When testing this, I utilized code to parse in inputs from the command-line. But as this was not my own code, I've opted against posting it here. It is my goal to finish this project with this parsing functionality completed. 


Some general background, at the time of making this, I was inspired to make code faster (via multithreading) as well as encryption. So, I thought the creation of said project would be a good aid in understanding both concepts!
